## Workshop Goals

This hands-on workshop provides a tutorial of how to build a clinical dashboard for tracking PROs and response rates. Dashboards provide study teams with a centralized, on-demand hub for visualizing key study metrics, replacing the need for ad-hoc reporting. We will introduce methods for quickly developing a dashboard using free-to-use, open-source programming environments (R/RStudio). R is a statistical and graphing-centered programming language which provides the dashboard structure, allowing integration from multiple data sources, data manipulation and analysis, and construction of visual pieces needed for communicating data to stakeholders. Participants will learn to weave together these elements, allowing for the creation of simple, elegant dashboards to track PROs and other clinical data. Participants will then learn how to deploy and share the dashboard with team members.



## Intended Audience

Beginner to intermediate. This workshop does not require any prior knowledge of statistical programming, but familiarity with R or general programming principles will be helpful. Intended audience members include clinicians, research professionals, or statisticians who need/want to learn how to visualize data including clinical trials, retrospective databases, and PROs. Participants will be required to bring their own personal laptop.



## Learning Objectives

1.	Participants will become familiar with the underlying programming (R/RStudio) techniques necessary to create a clinical dashboard. They will be given the tools to be able to load data from various sources, build visual elements, and scaffold and deploy a dashboard.  
2.	Participants will become familiar with the necessary free library packages that are utilized to build dashboard structure and interactivity. With these elements and our support, participants will combine these tools to create a simple dashboard to track quality-of-life protocol adherence from a blank canvas to a finished product. 
3.	Participants will be immersed into current real-world dashboard applications involving clinical trials, prospective registries, and retrospective dashboards.  This objective will provide the participant with possible future directions and applications involving artificial intelligence, protocol lifetime management, and clinical patient tracking.

## Instructors

__Instructors: Michael Golafshar, Molly Voss and Todd DeWees__

All presenters are experienced researchers in the division of Biostatistics and Informatics at Mayo Clinic - Arizona.  Michael Golafshar, MS innovated the combination and utilization of these disparate free-ware programming packages to create awe-inspiring interactive dashboards that have gained widespread attention across the Mayo Enterprise.  Molly Petersen has extensive experience in programming and statistics, creating her own R packages and working on highly successful clinical research such as the Mayo developed Cologuard®.  Todd DeWees, PhD has been a cancer researcher for over a decade with publications in biological, physics, and clinical research.  His current research interests in PROs has guided the clinical use of dashboards as well as the development and inclusion of novel utilization of neural networks (Artificial Intelligence) to predict changes in patient reported outcomes.  All the organizers have a deep understanding and years of applied experience in R and dashboard creation for clinical trials.
